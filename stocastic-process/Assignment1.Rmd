# Q1  

## Generate the transition probabilities
the Markov chain state space $S ={H,D,Y}$ where H represents Harvard, D for Dartmouth and y for Yale
```{r}
states = c("H", "D", "Y")
trans_mat1 <- matrix(c(.6, 0, .4,
              .3, .5, .2,
              .35, .35, .3), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)

rownames(trans_mat1) = states
colnames(trans_mat1) = states
print(trans_mat1)
```
## Draw the transition states with their respective probabilities

```{r}
mk_chain1 = new("markovchain",
                 states=states,
                 transitionMatrix=trans_mat1,
                 name="HDY",
                )

plotmat(trans_mat1,relsize = 0.75)
```
